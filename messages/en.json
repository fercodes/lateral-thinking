      "overview": "Apex Commerce is a fully custom headless ecommerce solution designed for a luxury fashion retailer looking to scale their online presence internationally. The platform supports multi-currency, multi-language, and region-specific catalogs with a seamless checkout experience.",
      "challenge": "The existing monolithic platform was struggling under traffic spikes during seasonal launches, with page load times exceeding 8 seconds and a cart abandonment rate of 78%. The client needed a modern solution that could handle global traffic while maintaining the premium brand experience their customers expected.",
      "solution": "We architected a headless commerce stack with Next.js on the frontend and a custom API layer backed by a composable commerce engine. Static generation for product pages combined with ISR for inventory-sensitive data gave us the best of both worlds — blazing speed with real-time accuracy. A custom CDN strategy ensured sub-200ms TTFB globally.",

      "challenge": "The client, a mid-size logistics company, was drowning in data but starving for insights. Their analysts spent 80% of their time writing SQL queries and building manual reports, leaving little room for actual strategic analysis. They needed a tool that could democratize data access across the organization.",
      "solution": "We built a custom NLP layer that translates natural language queries into optimized database operations, backed by a fine-tuned LLM for context-aware interpretation. A real-time streaming pipeline ensures dashboards stay current, while a predictive engine surfaces anomalies and trends before they become problems.",

      "overview": "Flow CRM is a purpose-built customer relationship management system designed for a SaaS company with a complex B2B sales cycle. Unlike off-the-shelf solutions, every feature was tailored to their specific workflow, from lead scoring to contract management.",
      "challenge": "The sales team was using a combination of spreadsheets, a legacy CRM, and email threads to manage a pipeline of 2,000+ active deals. Critical follow-ups were being missed, lead scoring was manual and inconsistent, and management had zero visibility into pipeline health without hours of manual consolidation.",
      "solution": "We designed a CRM from the ground up around their sales methodology, with automated lead scoring based on engagement signals, intelligent follow-up scheduling, and a real-time pipeline dashboard. Deep integrations with their email, calendar, and billing systems eliminated double-entry and created a single source of truth.",

      "result1": "Close rate improved from 12% to 21%",
